# Siddhi Secure Skill Streaming Social Token Network
- Self Organized and Self Stablized Skill Streaming Protocol on Matic Network

## Introduction

SiddhiNet is a Secure Streaming Network for Social Token Distribution for Skilled Professionals within Self Organized Networks. Skills are defined as Self Soverign Social Tokens. Privacy Preserving Proofs are constructed using Zokrates Toolkit for Skill Self Verification, Sequence Verification and Summary Verification. Skill Social Tokens are generated as ERC 721. Skill Session Tokens are generated from Chainlink VRF. Skill Selection Oracles are also constructed from ChainLink VRF. Skill Streams are constructed from ERC 1620 Specifications. Skill Social Tokens are anonymized on Zether Framework.
