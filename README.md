Media Monetisation Framework on NEAR Protocol
=============================================

## Inspiration
- Orkut approach to social network monetisation
- Netflix approach to video story monetisation
- YouTube approach to video stream monetisation
- Vimeo approach to video content monetisation
- Disney approach to video art monetisation

## Introduction
- A Layer 3 interoperability and integrity protocol powered by our award winning Semiott Streaming Framework
- Aimed to create streaming services of verifiable advertisement contents and channels from across Ethereum, Binance, Harmony etc.

## What it does
- Time Tokenisation of New Media 
- Trust Tokenisation of New Media

## How we built it
- NEAR Protocol
- JavaScript
- Rust
- Rainbow Bridge
- Aurora Engine
- NodeJS
- NPM
- YARN

# Problem
- Lack of traceability in the international print media
- Excess of centralisation in the international print media
- Lack of interoperability between media monetisation networks
- Limited scalability for media monetisation systems
- Lack of authenticity of advertisements and adverts
- Lack of heterogeneity in media contents and culture

## Technology
- Ethereum - NEAR - Cross Chain Shard Rainbow Bridge
- Tokenisation of Advertisements into Fractional NFT
- Application of ERC 1155 and ERC 721 Standards
- Implementation of Interactive NFT Specification

## Applications
- A basic contract app with boilerplate code
- A basic dao app with JavaScript SDK

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Innovations on the lifecycle of Media Monetisation Networks
- First ever integration of Fractional NFT on NEAR Protocol
- First ever implementation of Interactive NFT on NEAR Protocol
- First ever integration of Rainbow Bridge and Aurora Engine

# Roadmap
- Integration of Zero Knowledge Proofs
- Integration of Verifiable Delay Functions
- Implementation of Time Trust Tokens using NEAR Protocols
- Implementation of Dynamic Digital NFTs for Advertisements
- Implementation of Non Fungible Tokens on NEAR Protocols
