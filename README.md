Media Monetisation Framework on NEAR Protocol
=============================================

## Inspiration
- Orkut
- Netflix
- YouTube
- Vimeo
- Wikileaks
- Wikipedia

## What it does
- Time Tokenisation of New Media 
- Trust Tokenisation of New Media

## How we built it
- NEAR Protocol
- NodeJS
- JavaScript

# Problem
- Lack of traceability in the international print media
- Excess of centralisation in the regional print media
- Lack of interoperability between print media networks
- Limited scalability for print media messaging systems
- Lack of authenticity of advertisements and adverts

# Solution
- Time Tokenisation of print media content
- Conversion of print media into non fungible tokens

## Technology
- Ethereum - NEAR - Cross Chain Shard Rainbow Bridge
- Tokenisation of Advertisements into Fractional NFT
- Application of ERC 1155 and ERC 721 Standards
- Implementation of Interactive NFT Specification

## Applications
- A basic contract app with boilerplate code
- A basic dao app with JavaScript SDK
- A basic client app using NEAR cli

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Innovations on the lifecycle of New Media 
- Implementation of a new computational framework for media

## Challenges
- Issues with NEAR CLI setup

# Technology
- NEAR SDK
- Ethereum - NEAR Bridge
- NPM
- NodeJS

# Roadmap
- Integration of Zero Knowledge Proofs
- Integration of Verifiable Delay Functions
- Implementation of Time Tokens using NEAR Protocols
- Implementation of Non Fungible Tokens on NEAR Protocols
